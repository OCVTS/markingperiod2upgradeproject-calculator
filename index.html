                <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>This is my project, it is a simple calculator that helps us to make simple equations, it is not perfect,
                    but I still developing this, it can be useful for the ordinary use.<br> It is useful for caculations like additions, subtractions,
                    multiplication and division, you can also make multiple calulation.
                </p>
                <h2>Development process:</h2>
                <p>
                    I developed this project accordingo on what I was needing, at first, I needed to make consecutive calculations, so I did it, I also added the point for the numbers,<br>
                    I added a section for the previous answer, and I was fixing errors, for example to put many consecutive simbols, I was traying to make it with the less posible errors.
